DAWG article, originally published in April 11, 2011:

- [`dawg.asciidoc`][dawg.asciidoc] — AsciiDoc source file.
- [`dawg.html`][dawg.html] — Generated HTML version ([Live HTML Preview]).

The original article was converted to AsciiDoc by [Tristano Ajmone], with a few adaptations to meet the standards and needs of the new format, none of which altered the original contents (added extra headings for TOC purposes, adopted AsciiDoc style and formatting conventions, and other similar cosmetic and editorial tweaks).
